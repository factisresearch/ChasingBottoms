ChasingBottoms
--------------

Building
--------

To build: Use Cabal, or use ghc --make Test.ChasingBottoms. (If
Test.ChasingBottoms is already installed you may need to add something
like -ignore-package ChasingBottoms.)

Do not use Cabal to build the documentation. Use make docs instead.
You may need to edit the Makefile first.

To run through the test suite, execute Test.ChasingBottoms.Tests.main.

Possible future work
--------------------

* Making it easier to test equality etc. of functions. (This may be
  easier using the new version of Scrap your boilerplate, Scrap your
  boilerplate with class.)

* More custom generators for partial and infinite values.

Known bugs
----------

None.
