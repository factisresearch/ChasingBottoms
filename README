Building
--------

To build: Use Cabal, or use ghc --make Test.ChasingBottoms. (If
Test.ChasingBottoms is already installed you may need to add something
like -ignore-package ChasingBottoms-X.Y.Z.)

Do not use Cabal to build the documentation. Use make docs instead.
You may need to edit the Makefile first.
